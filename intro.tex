\large \chapter*{Abstract} \normalsize \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract} Selecting the right location is critical for success in the highly competitive cafe and restaurant industry, yet many entrepreneurs rely on intuition or limited data when making this decision. This project proposes a Location Intelligence and Decision Support Platform designed specifically for cafe and restaurant site selection in Bhaktapur. The system evaluates competitor presence, nearby amenities and neighborhood characteristics to generate an Opportunity Zone heatmap and a personalized Suitability Score for any selected location. Leveraging a robust XGBoost Regressor model, the platform achieves an impressive R² score of 0.9615 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.1175 points on unseen data, ensuring high accuracy in its predictions. By providing clear insights and transparent reasoning behind each score, the platform helps entrepreneurs make informed, data-driven decisions and significantly reduces the risk associated with launching a new food-service business.\
