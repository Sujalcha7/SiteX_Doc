\section{Completed Works}

The following major components of the project have been completed:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Main Project User Interface:} \\

        \label{fig:main-ui}
    \end{figure}
    \par The main user interface integrates an interactive map with a sidebar for inputting location details, selecting radius, and visualizing POI distributions. It provides users with a comprehensive overview of the area, allowing them to explore and analyze spatial data efficiently.

        \caption{Filtering and searching interface with category-based POI filters and dynamic search results.}
        \label{fig:filter-search}
    \end{figure}
    \par This component enables users to filter and search for Points of Interest (POIs) by categories such as cafes, temples, banks, education, and health. The dynamic search panel displays the number of results per category and lists matching POIs, making it easy to focus on specific types of locations within the map.

        \noindent \caption{Result analysis dashboard showing success score, POI distribution charts, and detailed statistics for the selected location.}
        \label{fig:result-analysis}
    \end{figure}
    \par The result analysis dashboard presents a detailed breakdown of the selected location’s performance. It displays the computed success score, radar and bar charts for POI distribution, a donut chart comparing competitors with other POIs, and lists of top counts and detailed statistics for each POI category, supporting informed decision-making.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\par These completed modules form the core analytical and visualization features of the project, enabling users to perform spatial analysis and make informed decisions based on geospatial data.

\section{Remaining Works}

The following key components are planned for future implementation to enhance the site analysis platform for opening a cafe:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Heat Map Visualization:} \\
    Develop and integrate a heat map feature to visually represent popular or viable areas for opening a cafe. This will help users quickly identify high-potential locations based on aggregated POI data and other relevant metrics.

    \item \textbf{Demographic and Neighborhood Analysis:} \\
    Incorporate demographic data and neighborhood characteristics into the analysis. This includes integrating population density, age distribution, income levels, and other socio-economic factors to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of each location.

    \item \textbf{Area Comparison and Ranking:} \\
    Implement tools to compare multiple areas side-by-side, allowing users to rank locations based on various criteria such as POI density, demographic suitability, and accessibility.

    \item \textbf{User Analysis History and Comparison:} \\
    Enable saving of users' past analysis sessions, allowing them to revisit previous results and perform direct comparisons between different locations or time periods.

    \item \textbf{Enhanced Reporting and Export Options:} \\
    Add functionality for generating detailed reports of analysis results, including charts and maps, with options to export these reports in PDF or other formats for offline review and sharing.

    \item \textbf{User Feedback and Customization:} \\
    Implement features for users to provide feedback on analysis results and customize the weighting of different factors according to their business strategy or preferences.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
These enhancements will provide users with deeper insights and greater flexibility, supporting more informed and strategic decisions for cafe site selection.
